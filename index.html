        <h2>All the worlds a stage</h2>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>All the world's a stage, And all the <strong>men and women</strong> merely players;
        <br />They have their exits and their entrances,
        <br />And one man in his time plays many parts,
        <br />His acts being <em>seven ages</em>.</p>
      </div>
  
    <h2>Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? (Sonnet 18)</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
      <br />Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
      <br />Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
      <br />And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
      <br /></p>
      <p>Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
      <br />And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
      <br />And every fair from fair sometime declines,</p>
      <p>By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
      <br />But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
      <br />Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
      <br />Nor shall death brag thou wand’rest in his shade,</p>
      <p>When in eternal lines to Time thou grow’st.
      <br />So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
      <br />So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.</p>
